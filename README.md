The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a classic and simple hand game often played to make decisions or just for fun. It's based on three choices: Rock, Paper, and Scissors, with each option defeating one of the others in a circular pattern (Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock).

Though basic, it’s a game of chance and strategy, as predicting your opponent’s next move adds an interesting psychological element. It’s a timeless game that’s easy to learn, requires no equipment, and is enjoyed by people of all ages!
